# Bus-Delay-from-AVL-Data
Python based method for estimating traffic signal impacts on bus operations using AVL data.

Repository includes the "classes" module, which is a Python module developed for this analysis, and a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates 
importing and cleaning transit AVL/APC data, along with other varous GIS data, and ultimately execution of the method provided in the "classes"
module on a single Lynx bus route in Orlando, Florida. Outcomes of the analysis include signalized intersection delay, queue, and a ranking
of potential transit signal priority equipment deployment locations. 

The method relies heavily on the following Python libraries: Shapely, GeoPandas, Pandas, Numpy.
